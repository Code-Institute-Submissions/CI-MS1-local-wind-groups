<h1 align="center">Local Wind Groups Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://tubaman48.github.io/CI-MS1-local-wind-groups)


### The aim of this website is to **grow community involvement and spread awareness** of brass bands, concert bands, orchestras and music services that are available in South East London.
### It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for two distinct groups of users :
-   ### Woodwind and brass players searching for a local group to play in.
-   ### Event organisers seeking to engage / hire the services of a local group.

## Overview

> During the Covid-19 crisis, the amateur music making scene across the UK has been forced into hiberation with very little opportunity for playing together in groups of more than six. This has caused upheaval in the membership levels of many groups as people re-evaluate the priorities in their life. 
> There is currently no easy internet search which collectively lists organisations available in the South East London area for :
   a) woodwind and brass players to join
   b) event organisers to engage / hire the services of.

---

## Description

> The Local Wind Groups Project is dedicated to increasing the awareness of groups involved in music making to woodwind and brass players and event organisers in the South East London area by providing a targeted directory service.

---

## UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. 
The priority focus is on direct contact and social media links.

- ### 1. Strategy

> The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community engagement, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact via email and/or join our Facebook community Page.
>
> #### Project Goals:
>
> - Raising awareness of the local music groups available for woodwind and brass players to join.
> - Building on community awareness and engagement of the music groups that are available in the South East London area.
> - Maintain the integrity of this directory by engaging local music makers to provide current details of relevant organisations (website plus contact via email address and social media).
>
> #### Customer Goals:
>
> - Designed site with Mobile-first approach
> - Easy-to-read info. Long enough to understand the content, yet short enough not to overwhelm.
> - Imagery used for intuitive explanation of groups available and showing the branding logos of individual organisations.
> - Contact form with radio button options to categorise the organisation type.
> - Easy reference to Social Media from anywhere on the site.
> - Strong contrasting Social Media icons in the footer.
> - Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
> - Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

- ### 2. Scope

> I've decided on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach, which:
>
> - Provides a clean UX for users.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch via email or social media.

- ### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly focus in on organisations of interest to them. 
> Short, focused paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to project the range of organisations available locally.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form and links to Social Media in Footer.

- ### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](/assets/docs/RL-CI-MS1-Wireframes.pdf): A website of 6 pages made up of a landing page, 4 variants of a details page for each listing category and a maintenance page.
>
> - Home, Brass Band Listing, Concert Band Listing, Orchestra Listing, Music Service Listing and Directory Entry Maintenance Section/Pages
>
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 6 pages.
>
> - Fixed Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons
>
> Note that a subsequent redesign (instigated as a result of Mentor feedback on user experience received mid-project) resulted in the 4 separate listing pages being merged into the landing page. 
> I plan to rework the wireframes document in a future revision. 

---

- ### 5. Surface

I've decided on a colour scheme to reflect each of the four listing categories to keep a sense of where you are searching.

> #### Colours
>
> Soft (neutral) pastel green (#98d4a6) chosen as the background colour for the generic header section (including navigation bar).
> For the four listing categories the menu select from the landing page and the subheading of each of the category pages uses an off-white (#fafafa) font colour against the individual background colours, maintaining string, balanced contrasts.
> - The Brass Band category uses a brass background colour (#c7a903)
> - The Concert Band category uses a woodwind "grey to black" background colour (#6b7279).
> - The Orchestra category uses string "veneered wood" background colour (#917070).
> - The Music Service category uses a green background colour (#008000) to relate to new learning opportunities.
> For body text, I've used a combination of a dark grey (#242424) and off-white (#fafafa), maintaining strong, balanced contrasts.
> 
> #### Typography
>
> - "Lato" font (with fall-back font of Verdana) for main headings. This font was specifically chosen for the header page title and subtitle.
> - "Oswald" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> #### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict the target audiences for this directory to make this a more welcoming resource.

---

## Testing

> - After initial wireframe design, I checked each navigation item link is working correctly to each section or page. I set a _temporary_ contrasting background colour to each page to mark out each section.
> - Tested responsiveness of the wireframe using Dev Tools and confirmed basic structure looks and works well on all mobile decides from 320px, up to desktop size.
> - Tested **Logo text** in menu bar to ensure it points to the Home page.
> - Tested **Home, Brass Bands, Concert Bands, Orchestras, Music Services & Changes** links in menu bar to ensure it points to each section/page and positions correctly.
> - Tested **Social Media icons** in Footer to ensure they open the correct pages, and in a new tab on the browser.
> - Tested **Website and Contact Form** links for each organisation on each of the category pages and ensured that they open the correct locations in a new tab on the browser.
> - Tested **eMail** links for each organisation on each of the category pages and ensured that they pointed to the correct locations, using the mailto: prefix.
> - Tested **Submit** button on Changes (Proposed Maintenance) page without any text in inputs to ensure that it provides the desired error of 'Please fill out this field' to appropriate required fields.
> - Tested **Email** entry input by not entering a valid email address. This provides the desired error of 'Please include an @ in the email address'.
> - Tested **URL** entry input by not entering a valid URL address. This provides the desired error of 'Please provide a valid URL format'.
> - Tested **Radio buttons** to ensure only _one option can be selected_ and that _at least one option_ is required.
> - Tested **Drop down menu** to ensure only _one option can be selected_ and that _at least one option_ is required.
> - Further testing of Responsiveness of all pages using [Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
> - 1. [Home Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=FHhr9lU9MyrTyvRhiWMNIQ)
> - 2. [Changes (Proposed Maintenance) Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=HkEcYFYgBJdyTWrWFW6Dng)
> - Tested overall site colours on [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/), a Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. Tests for both of the pages came back with excellent results (any reported anomalies were misdiagnosed).
> - Tested [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) No errors or warnings to show.
> - Tested [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
> - 1.  Under Fieldset definition "Property xxx doesn't exist" Error on 6 items. Researched this and found that this is a non-issue as the 6 properties are required within the fieldset element to correctly format padding and margins in the modal form.
> - 2.  Warning 'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'. Confident to ignore these after researching and a common answer is that the validator will not validate imported style sheets. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25946111/importing-css-is-ending-up-with-an-error).
> - Tested site URL on [Website Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) which rendered good results. Some images are on the large size in PNG format and already compressed. I chose to maintain the PNG format as the image quality of the site is integral to the UX.
> - Tested site URL on [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) which highlighted a cropping of the placeholder text on the form for the Contact eMail and Group icon fields when displayed on mobile phones in portrait mode.
>   Fixed by rewording placeholder text to more concise description.
> - Checked grammar and spelling throughout document.
> - Ran CSS through [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and copied new CSS code back into style.css doc.
> - Re-ran CSS Validation and 6 warnings appeared for 'unknown vendor extension'. Confident to ignore these as answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5271955/css-parse-errors-from-a-generated-stylesheet).
> - Ran README text through [Online-Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) to double-check on grammar and spelling.

## Project barriers and solutions

> - Difficulties encountered with initially enabling my default github.io website from my github account. My GitHub Pages settings in GitHub initially showed website as disabled, so when I tried to go to tubaman48.github.io I got a 404 "Page Not Found" error.
    Resolved (via quick assistance from Slack user ngiap in the CI #lets-deploy-it channel followed by an online engagement from CI Tutor Support) by ensuring Master branch selected along with /root location and clicking Save button, which updated the status of the website as validated and enabled me to access it OK.
> - In the original design a recode of text content in submit button at bottom of footer section was required after [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) objected to me embedding h3 and h4 tags within the button element.
    This didn't affect the functional behaviour of the button, but by replacing h3 and h4 tags with equivalent div tags I was then able to pass the HTML validation with no errors. Final design made this button redundant.
> - Inconsistent margin settings were causing visually unattractive white margin space on the right of the page at different sizes and also meant that a horizontal scroll bar was unnecessarily showing. 
    I used the Inspect Dev tool in Chrome to check where the inconsistency was and found that row class was adding 15px of extra margin left and right. This issue was resolved without any side effects by setting these margins to zero.
> - Sticky Nav bar would disappear when the header area scrolled out of view. This was resolved by placing the Nav bar right at the top of the Body section above and outside of the Header area.
> - When navigating to the start of each listing category the Nav bar would obscure the category title. The resolution was to set the top margin to the height of the Nav bar (56px).

## Code validity

> HTML - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) - Markup Validation
>
> CSS - [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - CSS Validation
>
> TAGS - [Closing Tag Checker for HTML5](https://www.aliciaramirez.com/closing-tags-checker/) - Validates all tags are opening and closing correctly.

---

## Version Control

> - Used Git for version control.
> - Branches were created to work on alternative fixes to issues encountered.
> - The branches were then merged with the master branch after any conflicts were addressed.

---

## Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

> - All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
> - The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/tubaman48/CI-MS1-local-wind-groups).
> - Under the [settings](https://github.com/tubaman48/CI-MS1-local-wind-groups/settings) section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
> - Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
> - Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
> - There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
> - The code can be run locally through clone or download.
> - You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
> - The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
> - The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
