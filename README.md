### Overview

> During the Covid-19 crisis, the amateur music making scene across the UK has been forced into hiberation with very little opportunity for playing together in groups of more than six. This has caused upheaval in the membership levels of many groups as people re-evaluate the priorities in their life. 
> There is currently no easy internet search which collectively lists organisations available in the South East London area for :
   a) woodwind and brass players to join
   b) event organisers to engage / hire the services of.

---

### Description

> The Local Wind Groups Project is dedicated to increasing the awareness of groups involved in music making to woodwind and brass players and event organisers in the South East London area by providing a targeted directory service.

### UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals and families from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. 
The priority focus is on direct contact and social media links.

---

#### 1. Strategy

> The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community engagement, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact via email and/or join our Facebook community Page.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Raising awareness of the local music groups available for woodwind and brass players to join.
>
> - Building on community awareness and engagement of the music groups that are available in the South East London area.
>
> - Maintain the integrity of this directory by engaging local music makers to provide current details of relevant organisations (website plus contact via email address and social media).
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Designed site with Mobile-first approach
> - Easy-to-read info. Long enough to understand the content, yet short enough not to overwhelm.
> - Imagery used for intuitive explanation of groups available and showing the branding logos of individual organisations.
> - Contact form with radio button options to categorise the organisation type.
> - Easy reference to Social Media from anywhere on the site.
> - Strong contrasting Social Media icons in the footer.
> - Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
> - Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

#### 2. Scope

> I've decided on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach, which:
>
> - Provides a clean UX for users.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch via email or social media.

#### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly focus in on organisations of interest to them. 
> Short, focused paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to project the range of organisations available locally.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form and links to Social Media in Footer.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](/assets/docs/RL-CI-MS1-Wireframes.pdf): A website of 6 pages made up of a landing page, 4 variants of a details page for each listing category and a maintenance page.
>
> - Home, Brass Band Listing, Concert Band Listing, Orchestra Listing, Music Service Listing and Directory Entry Maintenance Section/Pages
>
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 6 pages.
>
> - Fixed Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons

---

#### 5. Surface

I've decided on a colour scheme to reflect each of the four listing categories to keep a sense of where you are searching.

> ###### Colours
>
> Soft (neutral) pastel green (#98d4a6) chosen as the background colour for the generic header section (including navigation bar).
> For the four listing categories the menu select from the landing page and the subheading of each of the category pages uses an off-white (#fafafa) font colour against the individual background colours, maintaining string, balanced contrasts.
> - The Brass Band category uses a brass background colour (#c7a903)
> - The Concert Band category uses a woodwind "grey to black" background colour (#6b7279).
> - The Orchestra category uses string "veneered wood" background colour (#917070).
> - The Music Service category uses a green background colour (#008000) to relate to new learning opportunities.
> For body text, I've used a combination of a dark grey (#242424) and off-white (#fafafa), maintaining strong, balanced contrasts.
> 
> ###### Typography
>
> - "Lato" font (with fall-back font of Verdana) for main headings. This font was specifically chosen for the header page title and subtitle.
> - "Oswald" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> ###### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict the target audiences for this directory to make this a more welcoming resource.

### Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

> - All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
> - The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/tubaman48/CI-MS1-local-wind-groups).
> - Under the [settings](https://github.com/tubaman48/CI-MS1-local-wind-groups/settings) section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
> - Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
> - Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
> - There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
> - The code can be run locally through clone or download.
> - You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
> - The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
> - The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
